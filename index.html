<h1>Divine Purpose</h1>
<p>Unraveling Walls Parenting is my undoing,</p>
    <p>Unraveling into God's purpose—</p> 
    <p>God's Will, God's Love,</p> 
  <p>Love my body to death, dear Lord.</p> 
  <p></p>Cortisol, the sword that
  chases, 
  Yet I am the vessel, 
  A fragile home for the Divine. 
  How free is God’s
  will, 
  When I am captive in Christ's love? To walk a path without blueprint in
  my blood, In a world that criminalizes my very being. Criminalized, caged in
  concrete and steel, A box my village votes and pays to build, Where grace
  meets shame, And I am torn between both. A pilgrim seeking what cannot be
  found, Yet trusting in the unseen. Pilgrim—not the one whose language stirs
  guilt, But the one who journeys toward a holy place, In a world that rebels
  against my birth without trying. Walls built for protection Tumble down, Each
  brick crumbling, Revealing wounds never healed in the Sun, Or in the Son.
  Walking paradox— Both prisoner and free, Bound to Christ’s love and my child’s
  care, Yet aching for the freedom I once knew. Parts of me unfold, Leaving
  behind the unknown, Unseen, unspoken— Raw and real, Like deep scars etched
  into my skin. I break, Not to shatter, But to make room for something deeper—
  A surrender that becomes my strength, A surrender that is my only peace. Once
  strong, these walls now yield, Cracking open to let something new emerge- A
  strength not my own, A love too vast to contain, Too pure to ignore. I am a
  vessel, A journey in progress, Carrying more than I ever imagined. God’s love
  pours in, Overflowing in Abundance, And with each drop, The walls fall, Making
  room for what is sacred to grow. I surrender my plans, My pride, My ego, The
  blueprint I’ve spent a lifetime crafting. For in this unraveled state, I find
  the true design— One written in light, In the sun of His love, In the Son’s
  sacrifice. So let the walls crumble, Let the bricks fall, For in the
  brokenness, I am remade. I am not less— But more, Held together by a love That
  will never fail, A love that transcends all walls, cages, and stigma. For
  which my Beautiful, Creative, Intelligent, Resourceful Daughter has grown.
  Leaving me forever grateful for the c-section that left me dead— And dead, I
  lie still on that emergency room table so many years ago.
