  <h1>Canvas And Clay By Pat Barrett</h1>
  <p>In my mother's womb</p>
  <p>You formed me with Your hands</p>
  <p>Known and loved by You</p>
  <p>Before I took a breath</p>
  <p>When I doubt it, Lord, remind me</p>
  <p>I'm wonderfully made</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>You make all things work together</p>
  <p>For my future and for my good</p>
  <p>You make all things work together</p>
  <p>For Your glory and for Your name</p>
  <p>There's a healing light</p>
  <p>Just beyond the clouds</p>
  <p>Though I've walked through fire</p>
  <p>I see clearly now</p>
  <p>I know nothing has been wasted</p>
  <p>No failure or mistake</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>You make all things work together</p>
  <p>For my future and for my good</p>
  <p>You make all things work together</p>
  <p>For Your glory and for Your name</p>
  <p>For my good</p>
  <p>For my good</p>
  <p>And when I doubt it, Lord, remind me</p>
  <p>I'm wonderfully made</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>And I know nothing has been wasted</p>
  <p>No failure or mistake</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>You make all things work together</p>
  <p>For my future and for my good</p>
  <p>You make all things work together</p>
  <p>For Your glory and for Your name</p>
  <p>When I doubt it, Lord, remind me</p>
  <p>I'm wonderfully made</p>
  <p>'Cause You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>I know nothing has been wasted</p>
  <p>No failure or mistake</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
  <p>You're an artist and a potter</p>
  <p>I'm the canvas and the clay</p>
